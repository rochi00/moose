/**
 * A face functor whose face values follow from other functors rather than from stored data.
 *
 * A quantity that is an exact function of fields the provider already holds does not need storage
 * of its own: a stored copy can only ever agree or disagree with its definition, and keeping the
 * two in step means remembering to refresh it whenever an input moves. Expressing it as a function
 * removes that obligation, and with it the possibility of reading a value that was correct for an
 * earlier state.
 *
 * The function has to be total. The stored fields it replaces were zero-initialised, so a face they
 * had not reached yet read as zero rather than failing, and evaluations during initialisation rely
 * on that.
