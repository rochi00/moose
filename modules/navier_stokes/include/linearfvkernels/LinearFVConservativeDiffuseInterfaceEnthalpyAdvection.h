/**
 * Advection of the conserved mixture enthalpy density rho*h of a diffuse-interface flow. Each
 * phase carries its own upwind specific enthalpy with its own mass flux: the liquid's is the
 * liquid density times the limited volume-fraction flux, and the gas's is the remainder of the
 * mixture mass flux, both published by the volume-fraction corrector. The face enthalpy
 * h_k(T_upwind) is linearized about the lagged temperature of the upwind cell, with T expressed
 * through rho*h at the current volume fraction, so a uniform temperature is transported exactly.
